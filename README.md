# BBD CareerPulse AI

## Overview

BBD CareerPulse is an AI-powered career acceleration platform I built for the Kalpathon 2025 hackathon. The application helps job seekers optimize their resumes, identify skill gaps, and find personalized learning resources to land their dream jobs faster.

## Key Features

- **Resume Analysis**: AI-powered resume evaluation that identifies strengths and improvement areas
- **Skills Gap Analysis**: Visual comparison of your skills against job market requirements
- **Personalized Learning Recommendations**: Curated courses and resources based on your skill gaps
- **Career Insights**: Industry trends and statistics to guide your job search

## Tech Stack

This project was built with:
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui for UI components
- lucide-react for icons
- react-query for data fetching

## Future Improvements

I'm planning to add:
- User authentication
- Resume version history
- Job application tracking
- AI-powered interview preparation
